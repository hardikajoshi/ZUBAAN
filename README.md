# ZUBAAN

Our platform focuses primarily on animal welfare, as stated in our slogan, BE KIND TO ALL KINDS. When an accident involving a stray animal occurs, people can tap a button on our app, which will share the location of the area where the animal is, and the rescue team will immediately arrive. We are trying to make it hassle-free so even a busy one can help, with immediate rescue by animal welfare and veterinary doctors at various stops throughout the city. Our Ani Band Device, an intelligent collar for animals with lots of functionalities, can also collaborate with the government's forest department and animal welfare department to rescue wild animals. 



# Ml Tech Used :
Its prediction model is based on CNN using sigmoid and Relu functions; the test accuracy is 100% which is not correct because we used a custom dataset we are trying to gather more reliable data as of now.

Our Model Will work on two-parameter : 
To predict the Health Status of the Animal by using data on its, Temperature Heart Rate and Oxygen Level.
To determine the safety of animals by staying away from moving cars on the road using ultrasonic sensor data.
